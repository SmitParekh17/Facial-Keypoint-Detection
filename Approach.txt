1) Importing packages and Loading data

2) Checking missing values and dropping them

3) Handling image column as it is row ordered list of pixels

4) Normalizing pixel values for images and target variable

5) Looking few images with keypoints

6) Creating fully connected layer with earlystopping and Modelcheckpoint

7) Plotting graph for loss vs validation loss

8) Applying CNN

9) Data Augmentation : Keras ImageDataGenerator replace original image with augmented image and does not return both augmented image and original image.
		Approach 1: Increasing the size of Dataset by adding augmenting images
		Approach 2: Augmenting 50% of the images from batch on the fly

10) Applying Approach 1
	- Train test split data
	- Flipping the images and changing the coordinates of keypoints and saving the augmented images.
	- Adding augmented images to train data and shuffling the data
	- Applying CNN with Earlystopping and ModelCheckpoint.

11) Applying Approach 2
	- Train Test Split
	- Flipping the images and changing the coordinates of keypoints on the fly that is using ImageDataGenerator
	- Applying CNN with Earlystopping and ModelCheckpoint

12) Final model with Data Augmentation, Dropout, EarlyStopping and Modelcheckpoint.
